    description: `My experience purchasing a used vehicle from Chinook Auto Sales was excellent.  Dimitry and Roger were very pleasant to deal with, but much more importantly, they were very transparent, and acted quickly to have my conditions addressed without any hesitation.  With an mechanic on site to inspect, with a statement of inspection, it gave me the confidence I was transacting with owners with integrity.  From my first visit to their lot to driving off with the purchased car was 48 hours - smooth and hassle free.  They earned my review without reservations.`,
